## How to Run:
1. Execute [ConsoleApp.exe](https://github.com/DaBagelBoi/Cube/blob/773365c3b39a24cc185740737ac4415aa9fa3bb2/Assembly/ConsoleApp.exe)
2. Make sure that the terminal window that pops up is maximized, or that it's at least large enough to fit the entire cube

Got [ConsoleHelper.cs](https://github.com/DaBagelBoi/Cube/blob/773365c3b39a24cc185740737ac4415aa9fa3bb2/SourceCode/ConsoleHelper.cs) from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6554536/possible-to-get-set-console-font-size-in-c-sharp-net) so that I can change the font size. I was unable to find the original programmer.
